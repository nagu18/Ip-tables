Linux Networking & IPTables Notes ðŸš€

Welcome to my repository! Iâ€™m Nagendhar, and Iâ€™m on a journey to master Linux networking and IPTables. This repository is a collection of my notes, experiments, and practical implementations, focusing on:

âœ… Packet flow in Linux (PREROUTING, POSTROUTING, FORWARD, INPUT, OUTPUT)
âœ… Network Address Translation (NAT) â€“ SNAT & DNAT
âœ… Firewall rules and traffic filtering using IPTables
âœ… Routing and packet manipulation techniques

ðŸ“– My Learning Journey & Book Project

As I dive deeper into Linux networking, Iâ€™m also writing a book on the topic. This book will cover foundational to advanced concepts, along with real-world use cases and practical scenarios. At the end of my learning phase, I plan to publish the book, making it a valuable resource for network security enthusiasts and Linux users.

This repository serves as a work-in-progress knowledge base, and Iâ€™ll keep updating it with new insights, configurations, and examples.
